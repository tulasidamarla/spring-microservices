## Hexagonal architecture

- In a hexagonal architecture, the core of the application consists of the business logic. 
  Surrounding the business logic are various adapters that implement UIs and integrate with external systems.
- The business logic consists of modules, each of which is a collection of domain objects.
- Examples of the modules include Order Management, Delivery Management, Billing, and Payments. 
- There are several adapters that interface with the external systems. 
  - Some are inbound adapters, which handle requests by invoking the business logic, including the REST API and Web UI adapters. 
  - Others are outbound adapters, which enable the business logic to access the MySQL database and invoke cloud services such as Twilio and Stripe.
