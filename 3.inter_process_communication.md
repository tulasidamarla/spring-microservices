## IPC technologies

- There are lots of different IPC technologies.
  - Synchronous request/response based. Ex: REST, gRPC.
  - Asynchronous message-based communication mechanisms such as AMQP or STOMP.  
- Services can use human-readable, text-based formats such as JSON or XML.
- Alternatively, they could use a more efficient binary format such as Avro or Protocol Buffers.

### Interaction styles

- There are a variety of client-service interaction styles.
- The first dimension:
  - One-to-one—Each client request is processed by exactly one service.
  - One-to-many—Each request is processed by multiple services.
- The second dimension:
  - Synchronous—The client expects a timely response from the service and might even block while it waits.
  - Asynchronous—The client doesn't block, and the response, if any, isn’t necessarily sent immediately.
