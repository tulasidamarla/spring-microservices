## Designing business logic in microservices

- Developing complex business logic is challenging in a microservice architecture because the business logic is spread over 
  multiple services.
- There are two challenges that needs addressing.
  - Designing domain model that span multiple services because a typical domain model consists of interconnected classes 
    using object references.
  - Designing business logic that works within the transaction management constraints of a microservice architecture.
- The above two issues can be addressed using aggregate pattern from DDD.

### Aggregate pattern

- The Aggregate pattern structures a service’s business logic as a collection of aggregates.
- An aggregate is a cluster of objects that can be treated as a unit.
- Aggregates are useful when developing logic in microservices for the following reasons.
  - Aggregates avoid any possibility of object references spanning service boundaries.
    - `An inter-aggregate reference is a primary key value rather than an object reference.`
  - A transaction can only create or update a single aggregate, aggregates fit the constraints of the microservices 
    transaction model.

###  Business logic organization patterns

- Business logic is the core of a hexagonal architecture.
- Surrounding the business logic are the inbound and outbound adapters.
- This service consists of the business logic and the following adapters:
  - `REST API adapter:` An inbound adapter that implements a REST API which invokes the business logic.
  - `OrderCommandHandlers:` An inbound adapter that consumes command mes- sages from a message channel and invokes the 
    business logic.
  - `Database Adapter:` An outbound adapter that’s invoked by the business logic to access the database.
  - `Domain Event Publishing Adapter:` An outbound adapter that publishes events to a message broker.

- There are two main patterns for organizing business logic:
  - The procedural Transaction script pattern.
  - The object-oriented Domain model pattern.

#### _Designing business logic using the Transaction script pattern_

- A transaction script to handle each request from the presentation tier.
- The classes that implement behavior are separate from those that store state.
- The scripts are usually located in service classes, like OrderService.
  - A service class has one method for each request/system operation.
  - The method implements the business logic for that request.
  - It accesses the database using DAOs, such as the OrderDao.
- This pattern is used when writing the application in C or another non-OOP language.
- This approach works well for simple business logic.

#### _Designing business logic using the Domain model pattern_

- In an object-oriented design, the business logic consists of an object model, a network of relatively small classes.
- These classes typically correspond directly to concepts from the problem domain.
- In this design some classes have only either state or behavior, but many contain both.

- In Domain model pattern, the service methods are usually simple.
- A service method almost always delegates to persistent domain objects.
  - A service method loads a domain object from the database and invoke one of its methods.
- The domain objects contain the bulk of the business logic.
  - For ex, the Order class has both state and behavior.
- `Benefits`
  - The design is easy to understand and maintain.
    - It consists of smaller classes each having fewer responsibilites.
  - `Easier to test`
    - Each class can and should be tested independently.
  - `Easier to extend`
    - It can use well-known design patterns, such as the Strategy pattern and the Template method pattern, that define 
      ways of extending a component without modifying the code.
- To work with microservices, we need to use a refinement of OOD known as DDD.
