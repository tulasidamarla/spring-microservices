## DORA

- DORA metrics are used by DevOps teams to measure their performance and find out whether they are “low performers” to “elite performers”. 
- The four metrics used are
  - deployment frequency (DF),
  - lead time for changes (LT),
  - meantime to recovery (MTTR), and 
  - change failure rate (CFR).
